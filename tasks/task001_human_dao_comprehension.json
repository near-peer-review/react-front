Total amount $8500 split the costs 50/50 amongst\n     CDAO and MDAO. MDAO $4250 and CDAO $4250 Bridging a necessary gap in\n     production and setting new precedents. By seeking funding from both\n     the CDAO and MDAO, this initiative also serves as a model for how\n     NEAR projects can leverage targeted grants to grow their projects.\n     Summary of Engage-a-thon The Engage-a-thon is a marketing activation\n     designed to be a highligh\u2026\n\n   [26][Approved, paid] Near Digital Collective at ETH DENVER (NDC BUIDL\n   HOUSE) [27]NEAR Digital Collective\n\n     Proposal overview: The NDC BUIDL HOUSE is an initiative to foster\n     engagement within the web3 community. Organized in collaboration\n     with Supermoon, this activation will feature discussions,\n     interactive elements, swag distribution, and content creation,\n     addressing critical topics in the blockchain space. The event will\n     provide a conducive environment for discussions, networking, and\n     showcasing the potential of NDC within the context of EthDenver.\n     [28]https://x.com/Supermooncamp/status/17502349834179\u2026\n\n   What is the length of Commitment to Delivering Your Project? Will your\n   team be working on this project full-time?\n\n   Yes. 4 weeks of preparation from today but planning started several\n   weeks ago. With a week of post-event promotion.\n\n   Will your team be fully renumerated from this budget? Yes.\n\n   Section 9. Project/DAO longevity\n\n   Does your project/DAO require one-time or continuous funding?\n\n   This particular activation is one-time funding.\n\n   Will your DAO/Project device way of sustaining itself after this round\n   of funding?\n\n   Yes. This is a promotional tool and vehicle to synergize a handful of\n   top projects on NEAR and NEAR as a whole, including:\n     * ShardDog\n     * Blackdragon\n     * KeyPom\n     * Mintbase\n     * Minsta\n     * NEARHub\n     * Meteor Wallet\n     * Dragonverse\n\n   What are the possible roadblocks to the success of your project/DAO?\n\n   There are always unpredictabilities with any tech offering. Our goal is\n   to make things as simple as possible with as many ways to engage where\n   people are.\n \n\n Feedback: Hi [41]@rhymetaylor thanks for the proposal. I am happy to support this\n   for a one-time grant from the Marketing DAO. While we\u2019re supporting\n   funding for far fewer IRL events than we have in the past, here\u2019s my\n   reasoning on why this is a good fit:\n     * The project brings together a number of different strong\n       contributors to the ecosystem in an innovative with that leverages\n       multiple brands\n     * While the video itself is technically a creative project, it is the\n       cornerstone and key element to the wider marketing initiative\n       outlined, which is to drive interest and engagement in the NEAR\n       ecosystem and projects that include Mintbase, ShardDog and\n       $BLACKDRAGON\n     * One of the goals is to educate artists and musicians on real-world\n       use cases for NEAR.\n\n   Note that we will ask you to report on the outcomes of the deliverables\n   listed here. If some are speculative vs. confirmed, it would be ideal\n   to update this post so that there\u2019s a clear outline of what you\u2019ll be\n   reporting on in the future should funding be approved.\n",

We are using this as a chance to begin creating a stronger\n   foundation for educating artists, especially musicians about the\n   opportunities brought to them by web3.\n\n   Core Themes:\n     * New Distribution Models Offered in Web3\n     * Artist Royalties\n     * Masters\n     * Building and Owning Your Economy\n\n   To further expand on our experiential context to these themes, we will\n   be auctioning off the MASTERS of the song and music video recorded by\n   David Morrison on the new Near x Music page in collaboration with\n   Mintbase.\n\n   Additionally, we will be doing podcast interviews and hosting Twitter\n   spaces with key influencer accounts to publicize the auction further\n   and discuss the advantages artists have moving on-chain.\n\n   (Mission, Vision, Core programs and how they align with NDC\u2019s NDC CoA\n   Vision, team, and requested budget for the next three months)\n\n   Budget Total: $8900\n\n   What Problem Are You Aiming to Solve?\n\n   We need more high-level content and context for our suite of projects\n   leveraging NEAR.

Total amount $8500 split the costs 50/50 amongst\n     CDAO and MDAO. MDAO $4250 and CDAO $4250 Bridging a necessary gap in\n     production and setting new precedents. By seeking funding from both\n     the CDAO and MDAO, this initiative also serves as a model for how\n     NEAR projects can leverage targeted grants to grow their projects.\n     Summary of Engage-a-thon The Engage-a-thon is a marketing activation\n     designed to be a highligh\u2026\n\n   [26][Approved, paid] Near Digital Collective at ETH DENVER (NDC BUIDL\n   HOUSE) [27]NEAR Digital Collective\n\n     Proposal overview: The NDC BUIDL HOUSE is an initiative to foster\n     engagement within the web3 community. Organized in collaboration\n     with Supermoon, this activation will feature discussions,\n     interactive elements, swag distribution, and content creation,\n     addressing critical topics in the blockchain space.

With a week of post-event promotion.\n\n   Will your team be fully renumerated from this budget? Yes.\n\n   Section 9. Project/DAO longevity\n\n   Does your project/DAO require one-time or continuous funding?\n\n   This particular activation is one-time funding.\n\n   Will your DAO/Project device way of sustaining itself after this round\n   of funding?\n\n   Yes. This is a promotional tool and vehicle to synergize a handful of\n   top projects on NEAR and NEAR as a whole, including:\n     * ShardDog\n     * Blackdragon\n     * KeyPom\n     * Mintbase\n     * Minsta\n     * NEARHub\n     * Meteor Wallet\n     * Dragonverse\n\n   What are the possible roadblocks to the success of your project/DAO?\n\n   There are always unpredictabilities with any tech offering.

I note that you have support and collaboration for this event with @David_NEAR and appreciated the opportunity to discuss your project in our recent call.\r\nIf approved, please ensure that you submit a Report (including photos and links to the video)\r\nHappy to support.",
    "output": "No. Mentions the name of the proposer but doesn't say anything specific about the proposal",
      "explanation": "This statement leans more towards the negative example criteria. While it does show some engagement by acknowledging the proposal and noting collaboration and a recent discussion, it falls short in several key areas:\r\nLack of specific feedback: The council member does not provide detailed reasoning for their support or any constructive criticism that could help improve the project or its execution.\r\nMinimal engagement: The mention of support and collaboration is positive, but the lack of detailed commentary on the proposal's content or its merits means it's not as engaged or helpful as it could be.\r\nGeneric action request: The statement ends with a generic request for a report post-approval, which, although important, doesn't offer guidance or expectations for what the council member would consider a successful outcome.\r\n\r\nOverall, the statement shows a willingness to support but lacks the depth of engagement, detailed reasoning, and actionable feedback that would make it a strong positive example. It indicates a somewhat passive approach to the decision-making process, which is less aligned with the goal of ensuring thorough engagement and reasoned decision-making by all council members."

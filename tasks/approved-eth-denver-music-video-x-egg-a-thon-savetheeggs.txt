   Section 7. DAO/Project Charter/White or Litepaper and Goals

   Project Overview: Presentation with a short High-Level 6 bullet points
   summary:

   The Road to ETH Denver and Egg-a-thon is a collaboration inspired by
   the $BLACKDRAGON community meme token. It will be used to leverage
   several projects while creating an educational platform for musicians
   in a renewed approach to Near x Music.
     * A music video will be released via ShardDog at ETH Denver
     * Each video QR copy contains dragon eggs from NEAR DragonVerse
       collection.
     * Eggs received will be randomized by 1, 6, 12, or 13
     * A Golden Egg grand prize. TBD
     * QR Codes will randomize alternate album covers.

   Music Education

   The music industry is still much of an enigma, even to the artists
   themselves. We are using this as a chance to begin creating a stronger
   foundation for educating artists, especially musicians about the
   opportunities brought to them by web3.

   Core Themes:
     * New Distribution Models Offered in Web3
     * Artist Royalties
     * Masters
     * Building and Owning Your Economy

   To further expand on our experiential context to these themes, we will
   be auctioning off the MASTERS of the song and music video recorded by
   David Morrison on the new Near x Music page in collaboration with
   Mintbase.

   Additionally, we will be doing podcast interviews and hosting Twitter
   spaces with key influencer accounts to publicize the auction further
   and discuss the advantages artists have moving on-chain.

   (Mission, Vision, Core programs and how they align with NDC’s NDC CoA
   Vision, team, and requested budget for the next three months)

   Budget Total: $8900

   What Problem Are You Aiming to Solve?

   We need more high-level content and context for our suite of projects
   leveraging NEAR. With this activation, we are able to create anchor
   pieces of high-quality content and interject ourselves at one of one
   the biggest conferences in the U.S. which has the potential to resonate
   with non-crypto native audiences, but also amplify the attention of the
   current memecoin emergence.

     How we hope to fund this grant: A collaboration between CDAO and
     MDAO in funding. Total amount $8500 split the costs 50/50 amongst
     CDAO and MDAO. MDAO $4250 and CDAO $4250 Bridging a necessary gap in
     production and setting new precedents. By seeking funding from both
     the CDAO and MDAO, this initiative also serves as a model for how
     NEAR projects can leverage targeted grants to grow their projects.

   What is the length of Commitment to Delivering Your Project? Will your
   team be working on this project full-time?

   Yes. 4 weeks of preparation from today but planning started several
   weeks ago. With a week of post-event promotion.

   Will your team be fully renumerated from this budget? Yes.

   Section 9. Project/DAO longevity

   Does your project/DAO require one-time or continuous funding?

   This particular activation is one-time funding.

   Will your DAO/Project device way of sustaining itself after this round
   of funding?

   Yes. This is a promotional tool and vehicle to synergize a handful of
   top projects on NEAR and NEAR as a whole, including:
     * ShardDog
     * Blackdragon
     * KeyPom
     * Mintbase

   to make things as simple as possible with as many ways to engage where
   people are.

   Rhyme, this is brilliant and it’s wonderful having the opportunity to
   work with you on a small portion of this.

   Naturally, I have a conflict of interest I should declare (I’m in the
   video we’re creating), however there’s a few key points I’d like to
   highlight.

     Blockquote
     Music Video Shoot w/ David Morrison February 10th:
     Videographer: 800

   This is remarkably great value for what it is. We’ve hired the Founder
   of the same production team behind much of [37]NEARCON’s content (from
   the Foundation publication side).

   The NEAR Community so welcomed that team, they’re more interested in
   getting involved than ever (incredible welcome from everyone at
   NEARCON, kudos to all!).

   Finally, it’s no secret to existing NEAR Community members that
   [38]@rhymetaylor is, unironically, “all in”. He’s a pleasure to work
   with, an incredible light in the memecoin communities (EXCEPT FOR THAT
   DANG HEDGEHOG /s), and has been building in the NEAR ecosystem for >2y
   (correct me if I’m wrong).

   He’s done so almost entirely without payment from funding verticals
   (even from back in the day when we used to chime in on $10k book clubs,
   remember?! haha!)

   The initiative is a wonderful blend of creativity and on-chain
   activity.

   And, after all, it’s the year of the dragon :dragon:

   I appreciate the co-sign, as well as, your faith in the project and
   idea.

   It will officially be three years in March that I began our journey
   into NEAR and connected with members of NEAR Foundation about our
   initial ambitions.

   Though I have received funding in the past for a couple proposals, they
   were just to cover modest expenses. It wasn’t until the last two recent
   events that I received any personal remuneration, which was still
   significantly below market value for an agency or freelancer with my
   background, and the scope of the work (forum admins get paid more
   monthly than I have been paid total for the two events I was paid for).
   I’ve turned down far more for the greater good.

   This activation too falls significantly under market value for costs in
   scope of work and ROI.

   I’m infinitely grateful for the opportunities the near eveosystem has
   provided me. However, I do feel strongly about being more assertive in
   the value I bring to the ecosystem. But I’d also like to bring more
   value to the community at scale.

   I’m all in.

   Hi [41]@rhymetaylor thanks for the proposal. I am happy to support this
   for a one-time grant from the Marketing DAO. While we’re supporting
   funding for far fewer IRL events than we have in the past, here’s my
   reasoning on why this is a good fit:
     * The project brings together a number of different strong
       contributors to the ecosystem in an innovative with that leverages
       multiple brands
     * While the video itself is technically a creative project, it is the
       cornerstone and key element to the wider marketing initiative
       outlined, which is to drive interest and engagement in the NEAR
       ecosystem and projects that include Mintbase, ShardDog and
       $BLACKDRAGON
     * One of the goals is to educate artists and musicians on real-world
       use cases for NEAR.

   Note that we will ask you to report on the outcomes of the deliverables
   listed here. If some are speculative vs. confirmed, it would be ideal
   to update this post so that there’s a clear outline of what you’ll be
   reporting on in the future should funding be approved.

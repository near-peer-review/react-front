"   Hi [41]@rhymetaylor thanks for the proposal. I am happy to support this\n   for a one-time grant from the Marketing DAO. While we\u2019re supporting\n   funding for far fewer IRL events than we have in the past, here\u2019s my\n   reasoning on why this is a good fit:\n     * The project brings together a number of different strong\n       contributors to the ecosystem in an innovative with that leverages\n       multiple brands\n     * While the video itself is technically a creative project, it is the\n       cornerstone and key element to the wider marketing initiative\n       outlined, which is to drive interest and engagement in the NEAR\n       ecosystem and projects that include Mintbase, ShardDog and\n       $BLACKDRAGON\n     * One of the goals is to educate artists and musicians on real-world\n       use cases for NEAR.\n\n   Note that we will ask you to report on the outcomes of the deliverables\n   listed here. If some are speculative vs. confirmed, it would be ideal\n   to update this post so that there\u2019s a clear outline of what you\u2019ll be\n   reporting on in the future should funding be approved.\n"

It will be used to leverage\n   several projects while creating an educational platform for musicians\n   in a renewed approach to Near x Music.\n     * A music video will be released via ShardDog at ETH Denver\n     * Each video QR copy contains dragon eggs from NEAR DragonVerse\n       collection.\n     * Eggs received will be randomized by 1, 6, 12, or 13\n     * A Golden Egg grand prize. TBD\n     * QR Codes will randomize alternate album covers.\n\n   Music Education\n\n   The music industry is still much of an enigma, even to the artists\n   themselves. We are using this as a chance to begin creating a stronger\n   foundation for educating artists, especially musicians about the\n   opportunities brought to them by web3.\n\n   Core Themes:\n     * New Distribution Models Offered in Web3\n     * Artist Royalties\n     * Masters\n     * Building and Owning Your Economy\n\n   To further expand on our experiential context to these themes, we will\n   be auctioning off the MASTERS of the song and music video recorded by\n   David Morrison on the new Near x Music page in collaboration with\n   Mintbase.\n\n   Additionally, we will be doing podcast interviews and hosting Twitter\n   spaces with key influencer accounts to publicize the auction further\n   and discuss the advantages artists have moving on-chain.\n\n   (Mission, Vision, Core programs and how they align with NDC\u2019s NDC CoA\n   Vision, team, and requested budget for the next three months)\n\n   Budget Total: $8900\n\n   What Problem Are You Aiming to Solve?\n\n   We need more high-level content and context for our suite of projects\n   leveraging NEAR. With this activation, we are able to create anchor\n   pieces of high-quality content and interject ourselves at one of one\n   the biggest conferences in the U.S. which has the potential to resonate\n   with non-crypto native audiences, but also amplify the attention of the\n   current memecoin emergence.\n\n   DAO/Project Charter;\n     * How can your DAO / Project achieve NDC priorities, goals, and KPIs?\n     * Roadmap of your DAO/project, Milestones, and achievements\n\n   February 4th-10th:\n   Social Content:\n     * Tongue-in-cheek clips of David (D.Mo) and team getting ready for\n       transatlantic travel from London to Nashville and a glimpse into\n       the life of an international superstar.\n     * Posted on Twitter\n\n   Other To-Dos\n     * Create and Order Any Marketing Supplies/Merch\n     * Coordinate with KOLs to align coverage.\n\n   February 11th-17th:\n   Social Content:\n     * Tease BTS Footage from in Studio.\n     * Podcast Appearance #1\n\n   February 18th-24th:\n     * NEARWEEK Cover Story Goes Live w/ teaser clip from the completed\n       music video\n     * Illia changes pfp to egg/tweets teaser clip of music video\n     * Other KOLs and Key Influencers Also Change pfp/tweet\n     * Podcast Appearance #2\n\n   February 25th-March 3rd:\n     * Team arrives on-site at ETH Denver.

Total amount $8500 split the costs 50/50 amongst\n     CDAO and MDAO. MDAO $4250 and CDAO $4250 Bridging a necessary gap in\n     production and setting new precedents. By seeking funding from both\n     the CDAO and MDAO, this initiative also serves as a model for how\n     NEAR projects can leverage targeted grants to grow their projects.\n     Summary of Engage-a-thon The Engage-a-thon is a marketing activation\n     designed to be a highligh\u2026\n\n   [26][Approved, paid] Near Digital Collective at ETH DENVER (NDC BUIDL\n   HOUSE) [27]NEAR Digital Collective\n\n     Proposal overview: The NDC BUIDL HOUSE is an initiative to foster\n     engagement within the web3 community. Organized in collaboration\n     with Supermoon, this activation will feature discussions,\n     interactive elements, swag distribution, and content creation,\n     addressing critical topics in the blockchain space. The event will\n     provide a conducive environment for discussions, networking, and\n     showcasing the potential of NDC within the context of EthDenver.\n     [28]https://x.com/Supermooncamp/status/17502349834179\u2026\n\n   What is the length of Commitment to Delivering Your Project? Will your\n   team be working on this project full-time?\n\n   Yes. 4 weeks of preparation from today but planning started several\n   weeks ago. With a week of post-event promotion.\n\n   Will your team be fully renumerated from this budget? Yes.\n\n   Section 9. Project/DAO longevity\n\n   Does your project/DAO require one-time or continuous funding?\n\n   This particular activation is one-time funding.\n\n   Will your DAO/Project device way of sustaining itself after this round\n   of funding?\n\n   Yes. This is a promotional tool and vehicle to synergize a handful of\n   top projects on NEAR and NEAR as a whole, including:\n     * ShardDog\n     * Blackdragon\n     * KeyPom\n     * Mintbase\n     * Minsta\n     * NEARHub\n     * Meteor Wallet\n     * Dragonverse\n\n   What are the possible roadblocks to the success of your project/DAO?\n\n   There are always unpredictabilities with any tech offering. Our goal is\n   to make things as simple as possible with as many ways to engage where\n   people are.\n"
